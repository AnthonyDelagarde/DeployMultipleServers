# Deploy Multiple Servers on Azure
### Deploy multiple servers within an existing Azure virtual network. Windows 2019/2016/2012R2/Ubuntu 18.04.
### The solution is intended for deploying either production or development workloads in Azure Commercial and Azure Government.
### Please note that at the end of the server name I am appending a "-" and the next ordinal number. Example Server-1, Server-2, etc.
### We are adding an optional route table, network security group, and availability set for the virtual machines that are being deployed. 
### We are providing all of the server sku's available. Please vaidate before using this solution accelerator that the region you are planning on deploying has that sku. 
### Feel free to use, edit, and add functionality as you see fit. Solution is being provided "as is" for the greater technical community. 
### Use the solution with the Azure portal custom template deployment feature.
### Pleae enjoy and would love to hear feedback to improve the solution!
